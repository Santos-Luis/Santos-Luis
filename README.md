### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm Luis, a Senior Software Engineer at [Pipedrive](https://www.pipedrive.com/). I specialize in backend development, working primarily with **TypeScript**, **PHP**, and occasionally **Golang**. In addition to my backend work, I actively contribute to frontend projects using **ReactJS**, **GatsbyJS**, and **EmberJS**.

Beyond writing code, I have been involved in creating infrastructure and managing deployment processes, particularly for personal projects and past professional experiences. My expertise in this area includes extensive use of **AWS** services and **GitHub Actions**.
