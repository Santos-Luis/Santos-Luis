### Hi there <img src="https://github.com/TheDudeThatCode/TheDudeThatCode/blob/master/Assets/Hi.gif" width="29px"> 

I am Software Engineer working at [Uniplaces](https://www.uniplaces.com/). Currently I am doing backend projects in **Symfony** (PHP) and **NodeJS** and sometimes in **Golang**. I am also doing some frontend projects using mostly **ReactJS** and **GatsbyJS** but also **EmberJS**.

Besides writing the services code I am often involved in the creation of the infrastructure and deployment process. Most of my experience in this area is connected to **AWS** services.
